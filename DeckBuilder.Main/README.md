# ObjectFinalProj

//Nov 18
    This one I will need to work on the card variables themselves with thing such as the diffrenet card types and make a record for each of them and put them in a deck list. I probably could polymorph the artifact, enchantment or sorceries with the creatures and add on more types for it.

//Nov 25
    Which will be serialized into Json and stored into a file. The one problem I see with this is I should probably have it run the serializer immediatly after I build the deck as to save it to a physical form

//Dec2
    Make it interactable for the user rather than just running an endless program.

//Dec9
    Work out the final kinks and etc.
